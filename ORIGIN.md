# ORIGIN

This project originally began as a fork of the Heroku Node.js sample app:
https://github.com/heroku/node-js-sample

It has since been significantly restructured and extended by **Gabriel Cantero** to demonstrate modern release engineering practices, including:

- CI/CD automation with Jenkins
- Containerization via Docker
- Helm-based deployment to Kubernetes (Minikube)
- Health check automation and rollback support
- GitHub Webhook triggers
- Local Docker registry usage

This lab now serves as a fully self-contained DevOps training and portfolio project.

All commits from this point forward represent custom development and deployment pipeline engineering work.
